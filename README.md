## Description  :bookmark_tabs:
The motivation that I had to create "JATE" (Just Another Text Editor) was to develop an app that not only runs offline but also seamlessly installs on your computer, eliminating the need for constant internet connectivity and I found that really awesome. JATE is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that is user-friendly, offering you a space to write and note down whatever you desire. This technology allows users to install JATE directly onto their computer, combining the convenience of web-based and desktop applications. It was definitely a new learning experience, and I gained more knowledge about browser devtools. Experience the simplicity and convenience of JATE today!

## Installation :computer:

You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check the app, you can go to this URL: https://jate-text-editor-p1mn.onrender.com/
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have to clone my repository and run it locally.

## Usage :bar_chart:

If you want to try the app yourself make sure you have "Node.js" in your computer, and do not forget to run the next lines of code to start the app:
    
    npm i

After that run one of the next line:

    npm start

After you open it either locally or throw my URL, the app will look like this:
